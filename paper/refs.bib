- constraining hypotheses with partial knowledge: "use partial knowledge of word meanings to filter out impossible hypothesized meanings of utterances containing those words"
- cross-situational inference: meaning is commonality across all uses of that word
- covering constraints ...
- exclusivity: "children apply principles of exclusivity to constrain the possible meanings of some words in an utterance, given knowledge about the meanings of other words in that utterance"
- Children face the bootstrapping problem: they must begin to learn their first language with no prior knowledge of the language (Pinker, 1984; Gleitman, 1990).
Fisher et al. 1994 named it cross-situational learning
- we deal with at least 3 of the things that make language learning hard (according to Siskind): multi-word utterances, referential uncertainty, and bootstrapping
- the model's learning accelerates as more is learned (since it can use other forms of inference), and can ultimately learn words after only 1-2 occurrences with no "maturational parameter shift"
- homonymy (1 word, multiple meanings)
- when it detects noise, hypothesizes splitting a word to have two referents (that is, a special mechanism for homonyms -- will only work if sufficient noise detected)},
